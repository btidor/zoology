* consider making hypercalls into a tree, avoid copying
  (if we substitute down the tree, is this legal?)

* path merging (pass everything through `keccak256`)

* add mystery proxy, preferably in `Blockchain`

* unimplemented opcodes

  - EXTCODECOPY
  - CALLCODE
  - SELFDESTRUCT
  - GAS
  - (finish tests)

* better debugging

  - print subcalls, etc.
  - print state at end of each transaction
  - ???

* fix definition of `static`

* issues with infinite loops? have JUMP go back through min-heap
